    Hi, my name is Angelo Kounavis I come from Greece and I've been living in NY for the last 10 years. I obtain my
    Bachelors Degree in Business Communications and I've been working in sales since then. My short term goal would be
    to finish with the Code Fellow certification and then hopefully get a job in Software Development.
