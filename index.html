        Hi, my name is Angelo Kounavis I come from Greece and I've been living in NY for the last 10 years. I obtained
        my
        Bachelor Degree in Business Communications and I've been working in sales since then. My short term goal would
        be to finish with the Code Fellow certification and then hopefully get a job in Software Development.

        Cooking is one of my secret passions. I am not saying that I am the best at it probably far from it. However,
        whenever I cook I feel peace and at the end I get a sense of accomplishment with what I've made.
